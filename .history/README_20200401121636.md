# Scoping (Global & Local)

- Answers to question, where are your variables available for you!
- Scope determines the accessibility (visibilty) of these variables.
- In Javascript there are two types of scope => **Local scope** vs. **Global scope**.

### Global Scope

- Global variable is available everywhere. Global is not in function etc. Available outside of the {} symbols
- 'var' variables are attached to window. Thats because we should use let and const.
- It is not good practise to make global variables.
- Variables declared outside of functions, becomes Global variables.
- A global variable has a global scope. All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.
- There is only one Global scope throughou a Javascript document. A variable is in the Global scope if it is defined outside of a function (outside of a block)

### Variable inside Function Scope

- When variables are created inside a function, are only available in the function. Not outside.
- { } => are like fences, they wont let variables out!
- Functions can take variables in outside of function. Function goes always level higher, if there is no variables declared inside functions. Good practise is do not use same naming for variables.
- Variables declared within a function, become LOCAL to the function
- local variables can only be accessed from within the function
- Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions
- Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
- Function arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.

### Blocks Scoped

- Variables are scoped differently. (let, const, var).
- { } => are named as blocks. For example they are used in if statements.
- They are like gates, they keep variables in. When you need the variables to be available
  outside of blocks, just declare the variable before the blocks.
- There are multilevel scoping with blocks, where if statements can be inside functions. There we have multilevel scoping, be careful to know where your variables are available at.
- In for-loops there is good practise to use let i = 0. var will be available outside of the loop.
- Just remember to use const by default, let when you need and dont use var (whenever there is some usecase for It.)
- var variables are function scoped and let,const are block scoped.
- Variables declared within a block, become LOCAL to the block

### Function Scoped

- Function scoping works exatly the same way as variable scoping.
- Functions are scoped to parent function.
- This is also referred as Closure.

# Hoisting

- No matter where variables are declared within a particular scope, all variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope (global or local).
- Hoisting is done by Javascript feature called interpreter. Once again, interpreter moves the functions and variables declarations to the top of their containing scope.
- Simply this means that any declared variables, whenever they occur, are processed before any code is executed.
- on file functions are hoisted first, then variables.
- Declare all your variables at the top of their scope (at top of the global scope or at the top of the function scope.)

### Functions hoisting

- All the functions are moved to the top of your Javascript file at compiling.

### Variable hoisting

- While compiling the file, Javascript variables are moving to the top of the file.
- First, variables will be declared without values.
- Later on the file, compiler will update declared variables with their values.

# Closures **(Need to learn more)**

_Closures control what is and isnt in scope in a particular function_

- Ability for inner functions to access outer function scope.
- Ability to 'remember' the variables that wew present in function outer scope when they were defined.
- Keep in mind that every time there is a function defined inside another function - the inner one has the access to variables defined in outer function. This applies also to arguments (parameters) of the outer function.
- Closure applies to arrow functions as well as the standard function notation.
- The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scrope, even after the outer function has returned.
- Works when you return the inner function.
- Now you have access to 'private' variables.
- Using closure can help us write more readable code.
- A closure in Javascript is like keeping a copy of all the local (inside the function - scoping) variables, just as they were when a function exits.
