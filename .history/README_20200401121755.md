# Hoisting

- No matter where variables are declared within a particular scope, all variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope (global or local).
- Hoisting is done by Javascript feature called interpreter. Once again, interpreter moves the functions and variables declarations to the top of their containing scope.
- Simply this means that any declared variables, whenever they occur, are processed before any code is executed.
- on file functions are hoisted first, then variables.
- Declare all your variables at the top of their scope (at top of the global scope or at the top of the function scope.)

### Functions hoisting

- All the functions are moved to the top of your Javascript file at compiling.

### Variable hoisting

- While compiling the file, Javascript variables are moving to the top of the file.
- First, variables will be declared without values.
- Later on the file, compiler will update declared variables with their values.

# Closures **(Need to learn more)**

_Closures control what is and isnt in scope in a particular function_

- Ability for inner functions to access outer function scope.
- Ability to 'remember' the variables that wew present in function outer scope when they were defined.
- Keep in mind that every time there is a function defined inside another function - the inner one has the access to variables defined in outer function. This applies also to arguments (parameters) of the outer function.
- Closure applies to arrow functions as well as the standard function notation.
- The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scrope, even after the outer function has returned.
- Works when you return the inner function.
- Now you have access to 'private' variables.
- Using closure can help us write more readable code.
- A closure in Javascript is like keeping a copy of all the local (inside the function - scoping) variables, just as they were when a function exits.
