# Variables

- Variables store data in memory which can later be accessed and modified.
- Variables can also be reassigned and given a new value.

_let_

- **let** is a variable what can be changed later on.
- **let** is block scoped.

_Constants (const)_

- Many programming languages feature constants as values taht cannot be modified or changed.
- It is pretty much common convention to write all **const** identifiers in uppercase. This marks them as readily distinguishable from other variable values.
- Values that cannot change in programming are know as **immutable**, while values that can be changed are **mutable** (let).
- Constants are used most of the time. Only use **let** when you need to reassigne some values.
- **const** is block scoped.

### Variables naming

_Variable names are known as identifiers in Javascript._

- Variable names can consist only of letter (a-z), numbers (0-9), dollar sign symbol (\$) and underscores (\_).
- Variable names cannot contain any whitespace characters (tabs or spaces).
- Numbers cannot begin the name of any variable.
- There are several reserved keywords which cannot be used as the name of a variable.
- Variable names are case sentsitive.
- Good and practical use of variable names is a method called camelCase.
- Variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data it stores.

### Data types

_There is 7 data types_

- Numbers
- String
- Booleans _True or False_
- Arrays _[]_
- Objects _{}_
- NULL _When you set variable value to NULL_
- Undefined _When you have declared a variable but haven't give a value to it_
