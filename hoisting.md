# Hoisting

- No matter where variables are declared within a particular scope, all variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope (global or local).
- Hoisting is done by Javascript feature called interpreter. Once again, interpreter moves the functions and variables declarations to the top of their containing scope.
- Simply this means that any declared variables, whenever they occur, are processed before any code is executed.
- on file functions are hoisted first, then variables.
- Declare all your variables at the top of their scope (at top of the global scope or at the top of the function scope.)

### Functions hoisting

- All the functions are moved to the top of your Javascript file at compiling.

### Variable hoisting

- While compiling the file, Javascript variables are moving to the top of the file.
- First, variables will be declared without values.
- Later on the file, compiler will update declared variables with their values.
